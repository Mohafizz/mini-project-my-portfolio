/* the duplication in HtmlCssBlogCard, TodoListCard and UpcomingProjectCard suggests to us the repeated parts can be
refactored into a single component. The parts which are different should be passed in as props

I've refactored HtmlCssBlogCard.js for you into ProjectCard.js as an example, and replaced it in Projects.js
You can continue refactoring Once that's refactored, you don't need to create a new javascript file everytime you want to create a new ProjectCard. */

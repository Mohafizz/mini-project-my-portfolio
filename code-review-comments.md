What was good:
- Nice, mobile-responsive UI! I think this is something you can build on to make a really nice portfolio page.
- Generally, you applied what you've learned about React - in terms of class/functional components, props, state, etc. Nice work!

What could be improved:
- See inline comments in this commit
- When you find yourself duplicating / copy-pasting the code that you've written, stop and think about whether you can extract the units which you are repeating into a component
- Minor finetuning - choice of color, alignment of buttons (esp projects page in mobile view)
- Nice work integrating what you've learned about fetch and APIs! I would suggest extracting the weather app into a separate application, so that you can evolve it independently from your portfolio page.
